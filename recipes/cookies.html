        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>

        <li>2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and packed light
            brown sugar
            until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving
            some space
            between each cookie for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to
            cool
            completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
