    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (75g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (90g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for easy
            removal.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork or potato masher until smooth. You should have
            about 1 cup of
            mashed bananas.</li>
        <li>Add the melted unsalted butter to the mashed bananas and mix well until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the granulated sugar, packed light brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract to the banana mixture. Stir
            until
            thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the banana mixture, and gently mix them in.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the all-purpose flour to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to
            overmix, as
            this can result in a tough banana bread.</li>
        <li>Fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread
            comes out
            clean or with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the banana bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After cooling slightly, transfer the banana bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
        <li>Slice the banana bread, serve, and enjoy the moist and chocolatey goodness!</li>
    </ol>
