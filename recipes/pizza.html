        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional toppings:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup (35g) pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (50g) sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (75g) sliced bell peppers</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (40g) sliced onions</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30g) sliced olives</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) cooked sausage</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
            <li>Any other desired toppings</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 475째F to 500째F (245째C to 260째C). If
            you have a
            pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape and thickness. If using
            store-bought
            dough, follow the package instructions for rolling it out.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza
            stone.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded or sliced mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce, covering the entire surface of the
            pizza.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings evenly over the cheese. Be mindful not to overload the pizza with toppings, as
            this can make
            it soggy.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the pizza, and sprinkle the salt evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven. If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the hot
            stone in the
            oven.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is
            melted and
            bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, slice, and serve hot.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade pizza creation with your favorite beverages and sides!</li>
    </ol>
